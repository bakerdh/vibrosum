@article{Giriyappa2009,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Traditionally, vision has been considered the dominant modality in our multi-sensory perception of the surrounding world. Sensory input via non-visual tracts becomes of greater behavioural relevance in totally blind individuals to enable effective interaction with the world around them. These include audition and tactile perceptions, leading to an augmentation in these perceptions when compared with normal sighted individuals. The objective of the present work was to study the index finger somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) in totally blind and normal sighted individuals.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: SEPs were recorded in 15 Braille reading totally blind females and compared with 15 age-matched normal sighted females. Latency and amplitudes of somatosensory evoked potential waveforms (N9, N13, and N20) were measured.
RESULTS: Amplitude of N20 SEP (a cortical somatosensory evoked potential) was significantly larger in the totally blind than in normal sighted individuals (p < 0.05). The amplitudes of N9 and N13 SEP and the latencies of all recorded SEPs showed no significant differences.
CONCLUSIONS: Blindness has a profound effect on the Braille reading right index finger. Totally blind Braille readers have larger N20 amplitude, suggestive of greater somatosensory cortical representation of the Braille reading index finger.},

@article{Arslanova2022,
	abstract = {Many perceptual studies focus on the brain's capacity to discriminate between stimuli. However, our normal experience of the world also involves integrating multiple stimuli into a single percep- tual event. Neural mechanisms such as lateral inhibition are believed to enhance local differences between sensory inputs from nearby regions of the receptor surface. However, this mechanism would seem dysfunctional when sensory inputs need to be combined rather than contrasted. Here, we investigated whether the brain can strategically regulate the strength of suppressive interac- tions that underlie lateral inhibition between finger representations in human somatosensory processing. To do this, we compared sensory processing between conditions that required either comparing or combining information. We delivered two simultaneous tactile motion trajectories to index and middle fingertips of the right hand. Participants had to either compare the directions of the two stimuli, or to combine them to form their average direction. To reveal preparatory tuning of somatosensory cortex, we used an established event-related potential design to measure the interaction between cortical representations evoked by digital nerve shocks immediately before each tactile stimulus. Consistent with previous studies, we found a clear suppression between cortical activations when participants were instructed to compare the tactile motion directions. Importantly, this suppression was significantly reduced when participants had to combine the same stimuli. These findings suggest that the brain can strategically switch between a comparative and a combinative mode of somatosensory processing, according to the perceptual goal, by preparatorily adjusting the strength of a process akin to lateral inhibition.},

	abstract = {How does the cortex combine information from multiple sources? We tested several computational models against data from steady-state electroencephalography (EEG) experiments in humans, using periodic visual stimuli combined across either retinal location or eye-of-presentation. A model in which signals are raised to an exponent before being summed in both the numerator and the denominator of a gain control nonlinearity gave the best account of the data. This model also predicted the pattern of responses in a range of additional conditions accurately and with no free parameters, as well as predicting responses at harmonic and intermodulation frequencies between 1 and 30 Hz. We speculate that this model implements the optimal algorithm for combining multiple noisy inputs, in which responses are proportional to the weighted sum of both inputs. This suggests a novel purpose for cortical gain control: implementing optimal signal combination via mutual inhibition, perhaps explaining its ubiquity as a neural computation.},

@article{Bolanowski1988,
	abstract = {Although previous physiological and anatomical experiments have identified four afferent fiber types (PC, RA, SA II, and SA I) in glabrous (nonhairy) skin of the human somatosensory periphery, only three have been shown to mediate tactile (mechanoreceptive) sensation. Psychophysical evidence that four channels (P, NP I, NP II, and NP III) do, indeed, participate in the perceptual process is presented. In a series of experiments involving selective masking of the various channels, modification of the skin-surface temperature, and testing cutaneous sensitivity down to very low-vibratory frequencies, the fourth psychophysical channel (NP III) is defined. Based on these experiments and previous work from our laboratory, it is concluded that the four channels work in conjunction at threshold to create an operating range for the perception of vibration that extends from at least 0.4 to greater than 500 Hz. Each of the four channels appears to mediate specific portions of the overall threshold-frequency characteristic. Selection of appropriate neural-response criteria from previously published physiological data and correlation of their derived frequency characteristics with the four psychophysical channels indicates that each channel has its own physiological substrate: P channel and PC fibers, NP I channel and RA fibers, NP II channel and SA II fibers, and NP III channel and SA I fibers. These channels partially overlap in their absolute sensitivities, making it likely that suprathreshold stimuli may activate two or more of the channels at the same time. Thus the perceptual qualities of touch may be determined by the combined inputs from four channels.},

@article{Burton2004,
	abstract = {Blind individuals show visual cortex activity during Braille reading. We examined whether such cross-modal activations reflect processing somatosensory stimuli independent of language by identifying cortical activity during a one-back vibrotactile matching task. Three groups (sighted, early-onset, and late-onset [ 12 years] blind) detected whether paired vibrations (25 and 100 Hz), delivered to the right index finger, differed in frequency. Three successive paired vibrations, followed by a no-stimulation interval, were presented in a long event-related design. A fixed effects average z-score analysis showed increased activity throughout the visuotopic visual cortex, where it was mostly restricted to foveal and parafoveal eccentricities. Early blind showed the most extensive distribution of activity. Late blind exhibited activity mostly in similar regions but with declining response magnitudes with age of blindness onset. Three sighted individuals had suprathreshold activity in V1 but negative responses elsewhere in visual cortex. Mixed effects ANOVA confirmed group distinctions in defined regions (V1, V3, V4v, V7, LOC, and MT). These results suggest cross-modal adaptation to tactile stimulation in visual cortex independent of language processes. All groups showed increased activity in left primary (S1) and bilateral second somatosensory areas, but without response magnitude differences between groups throughout sensorimotor cortex. Early blind showed the greatest spatial extent of S1 activity. Blind participants had more extensive bilateral activity in anterior intraparietal sulcus and supramarginal gyrus. Extensive usage of touch in Braille reading may underlie observed S1 expansions in the reading finger representation. In addition, learned attentiveness to touch may explain similar expansion of parietal tactile attention regions. Hum Brain Mapp 23:210 --228, 2004. {\copyright} 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

            2. Gratings of variable contrast were generated on two oscilloscopes; these were superimposed optically. The angle of orientation between them could be changed. The threshold of one grating, the test grating, was determined in the presence of the other, the masking grating.
            3. When the gratings were presented with the same orientation (and locked in phase) the increment threshold of the test grating was found to be proportional to the suprathreshold contrast of the masking grating.
            4. As the angle between the test and masking gratings was increased the masking effect fell exponentially.
            5. At 12$\,^{\circ}$ on either side of a vertical test grating the masking effect was reduced by a factor of two with respect to its maximum value. This angle was independent of the contrast level of masking, the focus, and also the phase coherence of the masking grating.

@article{DiCarlo1998,
	abstract = {We investigated the two-dimensional structure of area 3b neuronal receptive fields (RFs) in three alert monkeys. Three hundred thirty neurons with RFs on the distal fingerpads were studied with scanned, random dot stimuli. Each neuron was stimulated continuously for 14 min, yielding 20,000 response data points. Excitatory and inhibitory components of each RF were determined with a modified linear regression algorithm. Analyses assessing goodness-of-fit, repeatability, and generality of the RFs were developed. Two hundred forty-seven neurons yielded highly repeatable RF estimates, and most RFs accounted for a large fraction of the explainable response of each neuron. Although the area 3b RF structures appeared to be continuously distributed, certain structural generalities were apparent. Most RFs (94\%) contained a single, central region of excitation and one or more regions of inhibition located on one, two, three, or all four sides of the excitatory center. The shape, area, and strength of excitatory and inhibitory RF regions ranged widely. Half the RFs contained almost evenly balanced excitation and inhibition. The findings indicate that area 3b neurons act as local spatiotemporal filters that are maximally excited by the presence of particular stimulus features. We believe that form and texture perception are based on high-level representations and that area 3b is an intermediate stage in the processes leading to these representations.

@article{Dougherty2019,
	abstract = {In humans and other primates, sensory signals from each eye remain separated until they arrive in the primary visual cortex (V1), but their exact meeting point is unknown. In V1, some neurons respond to stimulation of only one eye (monocular neurons), while most neurons respond to stimulation of either eye (binocular neurons). The main input layers of V1 contain most of the monocular neurons while binocular neurons dominate the layers above and below. This observation has given rise to the idea that the two eyes' signals remain separate until they converge outside V1's input layers. Here, we show that, despite responding to only one eye, monocular neurons in all layers, including the input layers, of V1 discriminate between stimulation of their driving eye alone and stimulation of both eyes. Some monocular V1 neurons' responses were significantly enhanced, or facilitated, when both eyes were stimulated. Binocular facilitation within V1's input layers tended to occur at the onset of the visual response, which could be explained by converging thalamocortical inputs. However, most V1 monocular neurons were significantly reduced, or suppressed, to binocular stimulation. In contrast to facilitation, binocular suppression occurred several milliseconds following the onset of the visual response, suggesting that the bulk of binocular modulation involves cortical inhibition. These findings, combined, suggest that binocular signals arise at an earlier processing stage than previously appreciated, as even so-called monocular neurons in V1's input layers encode what is shown to both eyes.},

The effects of stimulus frequency could be accounted for by the frequency characteristics of the Pacinian (P), non-Pacinian (NP) I, and NP III channels previously determined for the thenar eminence (Bolanowski et al., J Acoust Soc Am 84: 1680$\pm$ 1694, 1988; Gescheider et al., Somatosens Mot Res 18: 191$\pm$ 201, 2001).

Although the effect of changing stimulus frequency and changing stimulus duration did not differ for the two sites, the effect of varying the size of the stimulus was significantly greater for the thenar eminence than for the fingertip.

	abstract = {Psychophysical thresholds for the detection of a 300-Hz burst of vibration applied to the thenar eminence were measured for stimuli applied to the skin through 1.5 cm2 and through 0.05 cm2 contactors. Thresholds were approximately 13 dB lower when the area of the contactor was 1.5 cm2 than when it was 0.05 cm2. The difference between the thresholds measured with the large and small contactors was significantly reduced when only the lowest thresholds obtained in the testing sessions were considered. This result supports the hypothesis that one component of spatial summation in the P channel is probability summation. In addition, threshold measurements within a session were less variable when measured with the 1.5 cm2 contactor. We conclude that spatial summation in the P channel is a joint function of two processes that occur as the areal extent of the stimulus increases: probability summation in which the probability of exceeding the psychophysical detection threshold increases as the number of receptors of varying sensitivities increases, and neural integration in which neural activity originating from separate receptors is combined within the central nervous system rendering the channel more sensitive to the stimulus.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Auditory stimuli modulated by modulation frequencies within the 30 to 50 Hz region evoke auditory steady state responses (ASSRs) with high signal to noise ratios in adults, and can be used to determine the frequency-specific hearing thresholds of adults who are unable to give behavioral feedback reliably. To measure ASSRs as efficiently as possible a multiple stimulus paradigm can be used, stimulating both ears simultaneously. The response strength of 30 to 50Hz ASSRs is, however, affected when both ears are stimulated simultaneously. The aim of the present study is to gain insight in the measurement efficiency of 30 to 50 Hz ASSRs evoked with a 2-ear stimulation paradigm, by systematically investigating the binaural interaction effects of 30 to 50 Hz ASSRs in normal-hearing adults. Design: ASSRs were obtained with a 64-channel EEG system in 23 normal-hearing adults. All participants participated in one diotic, multiple dichotic, and multiple monaural conditions. Stimuli consisted of a modulated one-octave noise band, centered at 1 kHz, and presented at 70 dB SPL. The diotic condition contained 40 Hz modulated stimuli presented to both ears. In the dichotic conditions, the modulation frequency of the left ear stimulus was kept constant at 40 Hz, while the stimulus at the right ear was either the unmodulated or modulated carrier. In case of the modulated carrier, the modulation frequency varied between 30 and 50 Hz in steps of 2 Hz across conditions. The monaural conditions consisted of all stimuli included in the diotic and dichotic conditions.
Results: Modulation frequencies ≥36 Hz resulted in prominent ASSRs in all participants for the monaural conditions. A significant enhancement effect was observed (average: {\textasciitilde}3 dB) in the diotic condition, whereas a significant reduction effect was observed in the dichotic conditions. There was no distinct effect of the temporal characteristics of the stimuli on the amount of reduction. The attenuation was in 33\% of the cases {\textgreater}3 dB for ASSRs evoked with modulation frequencies ≥40 Hz and 50\% for ASSRs evoked with modulation frequencies ≤36 Hz.
Conclusions: Binaural interaction effects as observed in the diotic condition are similar to the binaural interaction effects of middle latency responses as reported in the literature, suggesting that these responses share a same underlying mechanism. Our data also indicated that 30 to 50 Hz ASSRs are attenuated when presented dichotically and that this attenuation is independent of the stimulus characteristics as used in the present study. These findings are important as they give insight in how binaural interaction affects the measurement efficiency. The 2-ear stimulation paradigm of the present study was, for the most optimal modulation frequencies (i.e., ≥40 Hz), more efficient than a 1-ear sequential stimulation paradigm in 66\% of the cases.},

@article{Hamada2003,
	abstract = {Objective: To investigate the effects of hand posture on the modulation of neuronal interactions in the cortical finger regions of the human somatosensory cortex.
Methods: Neuronal magnetic fields, evoked by electrical stimuli to the thumb and/or to the index finger of the right hand, were recorded in different hand postures (`OPEN': opened hand and `CLOSE': both fingers in opposite position to pick up something) by using a whole head type magnetoencephalography. The equivalent current dipole (ECD) for components in the primary (SI) and secondary somatosensory cortices (SII) was calculated. The interaction ratio (IR) was calculated as a ratio of the vector sum of ECD moments evoked by respective stimulation of each finger to the ECD moment evoked by simultaneous stimulation of both fingers.
Results: The mean IR of N20m was significantly larger in CLOSE than in OPEN (p ¼ 0:033, ANOVA). On the contrary, the IR of P40m was larger in OPEN than in CLOSE ðp ¼ 0:042Þ. The IR of SII components was not significantly different between the different hand postures ðp ¼ 0:35Þ.
Conclusions: Neuronal interaction between the thumb and index finger in the human SI is modulated by hand posture. Provided that forming hand posture is related to receiving sensory input, the interaction modulation may play a role in the facilitation of somatosensory processing.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            In a single modality, the percept of an input (e.g., voices of neighbors) is often suppressed by another (e.g., the sound of a car horn nearby) due to close interactions of neural responses to these inputs. Recent studies have also suggested that close interactions of neural responses could occur even across sensory modalities, especially for audio-visual interactions. However, direct behavioral evidence regarding the audio-visual perceptual suppression effect has not been reported in a study with humans. Here, we investigated whether sound could have a suppressive effect on visual perception. We found that white noise bursts presented through headphones degraded visual orientation discrimination performance. This auditory suppression effect on visual perception frequently occurred when these inputs were presented in a spatially and temporally consistent manner. These results indicate that the perceptual suppression effect could occur across auditory and visual modalities based on close and direct neural interactions among those sensory inputs.},

@article{Ishibashi2000,
	abstract = {Objective: Somatosensory evoked magnetic {\textregistered}elds (SEFs) were recorded to investigate the interaction of the somatosensory inputs using the modality of electrical {\textregistered}nger stimulation in 6 normal subjects.
Methods: Electrical stimuli were given to the index (II), middle (III) or little (V) {\textregistered}ngers individually, and also to pairs of either the II and III simultaneously, or the II and V simultaneously. The interaction ratio (IR) was calculated as the ratio of the SEF amplitude by simultaneous two-{\textregistered}nger stimulation to the arithmetically summed SEF amplitudes of two individual-{\textregistered}nger stimulations.
Results: SEFs showed 3 major components: N22m, P30m and P60m. The N22m and P60m revealed a clear somatotopic organization in the primary sensory cortex (S1) in the sequence of II, III and V, while the P30m showed a cluster with medial location compared with N22m and P60m in S1. The N22m had a signi{\textregistered}cantly greater IR in II and III stimulation compared to that in II and V stimulation. The P60m also showed a similar trend in the IR but was greater than that of N22m. In contrast, the IR in P30m showed no such tendency.
Conclusion: The interaction of S1 was most in¯uenced when adjacent receptive {\textregistered}elds were activated in the modality of electrical {\textregistered}nger stimulation. Our results were consistent with the concept that the Brodmann's areas in S1 which produce the 3 components of the SEFs have different functional organization. q 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Neurosci. 22 (2002) RC205]. As the method has potential value for assessing brain plasticity in patients with unilateral hearing deficits, we studied binaural interaction in 10 healthy adults at different intensity levels. Cortical steady-state fields were measured with a 306-channel whole-scalp neuromagnetometer to amplitude-modulated sounds (carrier frequency 1 kHz), presented monaurally or binaurally at 45, 60 and 75 dB SL. The modulation frequencies were 39.1 Hz for the right ear and 41.1 Hz for the left. During binaural stimulation, the ipsilateral responses were suppressed more than the contralateral ones in both hemispheres, and the hemispheric balance shifted towards the contralateral hemisphere for inputs from both ears. The patterns of binaural interaction were similar at all three stimulus intensities. These data could be useful in examining patients who suffer from auditory disorders as well as in revealing basic mechanism of human auditory processing.},

@article{Krause2001,
	abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to examine the influence of non-painful electrical stimulus intensity on the BOLD response in human primary somatosensory cortex (SI). In ten healthy subjects, index and middle finger of the right hand were stimulated separately at two different stimulus intensities. The activated volume of single finger representations as well as the volume of representational overlap of the two activations increased following an increase in stimulus intensity. This effect was seen in two different subdivisions of SI, one in the depth of the central sulcus, presumably corresponding to Brodmann area (BA) 3b, and one on the crown of the postcentral gyrus, presumably corresponding to BA 1 / 2. Relative overlap (ratio of overlap volume to volume of individual finger representation) was larger in BA 1 / 2 than in BA 3b. Additionally, in both areas relative overlap increased significantly from low to high stimulus intensity. Relative overlap did not change when different correlation thresholds were employed arguing against an unspecific `spillover effect'. Analysis of signal intensity time courses indicated that the response difference to high versus low stimulus strength was not present during the initial seconds of stimulation, during which both led to a similar signal intensity increase. Only during the following maintenance level of the response did the response to high stimulus intensity reach a significantly higher plateau level than the one due to low intensity stimulation, an effect which was present in both areas, BA 3b and BA 1 / 2, respectively. {\copyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

	abstract = {1. The responses of single neurons in the primary somatosensory cortex of the cat to brief air-pulse stimuli were quantitatively examined. These controlled natural stimuli activated almost exclusively rapidly adapting hair units which, on systematic movement of the stimulus through the receptive field, gave unit-response profiles that showed the classical unimodal tent-shaped distribution. 2. Conditioning stimulus-induced inhibition of a response evoked by a fixed test stimulus was measured by systematically moving the conditioning stimulus through the receptive field. The spatial distribution of in-field inhibitory activity was unimodal and highly covariant with that of the conditioning excitation, the peak inhibition corresponding to the functional center of the excitatory receptive field. 3. Nearly one-half of the units studied evidenced inhibition extending beyond the excitatory receptive field, forming a "surround" inhibitory region; but these were usually restricted areas with rather weak inhibitory effects. 4. Time-course measuring revealed, on the average, inhibition effects measureable from 10 ms before to some 70 ms following conditioning stimulation, with peak inhibition delayed some 10--15 ms from the conditioning stimulus onset. We showed the backward inhibition, occurring with the test stimulus delivered before the onset of the conditioning stimulus, to be a property of the test response duration. Inhibition measured in the surround areas had essentially the same time course as the inhibition calculated from measurements made within the receptive fields. 5. The spatial and temporal profiles of the excitatory and inhibitory cortical unitary activity are thus very similar to the parametric features of psychophysical enhancement and masking. These findings suggest that the excitatory and inhibitory activities related to individual stimuli interact in multipoint stimulus paradigms so that simple unimodal composite profiles are synthesized.},

Electrophysiology shows that binocular integration of luminance contrast occurs early in visual cortex, but a specific systems architecture has not been established for human vision. Here, we address this by performing binocular summation and monocular, binocular, and dichoptic masking experiments for horizontal 1 cycle per degree test and masking gratings. These data reject three previously published proposals, each of which predict too little binocular summation and insufficient dichoptic facilitation. However, a simple development of one of the rejected models (the twin summation model) and a completely new model (the two-stage model) provide very good fits to the data. Two features common to both models are gently accelerating (almost linear) contrast transduction prior to binocular summation and suppressive ocular interactions that contribute to contrast gain control. With all model parameters fixed, both models correctly predict (1) systematic variation in psychometric slopes, (2) dichoptic contrast matching, and (3) high levels of binocular summation for various levels of binocular pedestal contrast. A review of evidence from elsewhere leads us to favor the two-stage model.},

Participants received concurrent vibrotactile stimulation at different frequencies to either non-adjacent left hand fingers (within-hand) or fingers on two hands (between-hands) for 4500 ms to elicit steady-state somatosensory evoked potentials (SSSEPs). They attended to either one or both stimulated locations, respectively, and responded to rare events embedded in the ongoing stream. Behavioral and electrophysiological results revealed competitive interaction of simultaneous stimulation with overall smaller SSSEP amplitudes and poorer behavioral performance in the within-hand condition. Spatial proximity of stimulation did not affect the magnitude of attentional gain, it resulted in the occurrence of an intermodulation frequency indicating integrative stimulus processing in the within-hand condition. Obviously, while this integrative stimulus processing resulted in or was a result of greater intrahemispheric competitive interactions, attention acted additively as a signal gain, which was independent of spatial competition.},

Although the vector-magnitude model is quite different from the probability-summation model which has been suggested previously, the contrast thresholds and psychometric functions predicted by the two models can be in agreement within 10\% for up to l0 s channels in the system.

@article{Schutt2016,
	abstract = {The psychometric function describes how an experimental variable, such as stimulus strength, influences the behaviour of an observer. Estimation of psychometric functions from experimental data plays a central role in fields such as psychophysics, experimental psychology and in the behavioural neurosciences. Experimental data may exhibit substantial overdispersion, which may result from non-stationarity in the behaviour of observers. Here we extend the standard binomial model which is typically used for psychometric function estimation to a beta-binomial model. We show that the use of the beta-binomial model makes it possible to determine accurate credible intervals even in data which exhibit substantial overdispersion. This goes beyond classical measures for overdispersion---goodness-of-fit---which can detect overdispersion but provide no method to do correct inference for overdispersed data. We use Bayesian inference methods for estimating the posterior distribution of the parameters of the psychometric function. Unlike previous Bayesian psychometric inference methods our software implementation---psignifit 4---performs numerical integration of the posterior within automatically determined bounds. This avoids the use of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods typically requiring expert knowledge. Extensive numerical tests show the validity of the approach and we discuss implications of overdispersion for experimental design. A comprehensive MATLAB toolbox implementing the method is freely available; a python implementation providing the basic capabilities is also available.},

@article{Severens2010,
	abstract = {Objective: Simultaneous tactile finger stimulation evokes transient ERP responses that are smaller than the linear summation of ERP responses to individual stimulation. Occlusion and lateral inhibition are two possible mechanisms responsible for this effect. The present study disentangles these two effects using steady-state somatosensory evoked potentials (SSSEP). Simultaneous stimulation on adjacent and distant finger pairs with the same and different stimulation frequencies are compared.
Methods: The index finger (IF), middle finger (MF) and little finger (LF) were mechanically stimulated with a frequency of 18, 22 or 26 Hz, respectively. Stimulation was applied for each finger separately, and for the IF (18 Hz) in combination with either the MF or LF for 22 and 26 Hz, respectively. A measure for interaction (IR) was calculated for the P60 component and the SSSEP amplitude.
Results: Significant interactions were found in both the P60 response and in the SSSEP response. Stimulation of adjacent finger combinations caused more interaction than distant finger combinations. No difference was found between stimulation of two fingers with the same or a different frequency.
Conclusions: Our results indicate that lateral inhibition is mainly responsible for the interaction effect. Significance: These observations provide further insight in the mechanisms behind interaction between somatosensory inputs. {\'O} 2010 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

	abstract = {Animal, as well as behavioural and neuroimaging studies in humans have documented integration of bilateral tactile information at the level of primary somatosensory cortex (SI). However, it is still debated whether integration in SI occurs early or late during tactile processing, and whether it is somatotopically organized. To address both the spatial and temporal aspects of bilateral tactile processing we used magnetoencephalography in a tactile repetition-suppression paradigm. We examined somatosensory evoked-responses produced by probe stimuli preceded by an adaptor, as a function of the relative position of adaptor and probe (probe always at the left index finger; adaptor at the index or middle finger of the left or right hand) and as a function of the delay between adaptor and probe (0, 25, or 125 ms). Percentage of response-amplitude suppression was computed by comparing paired (adaptor 1 probe) with single stimulations of adaptor and probe. Results show that response suppression varies differentially in SI and SII as a function of both spatial and temporal features of the stimuli. Remarkably, repetition suppression of SI activity emerged early in time, regardless of whether the adaptor stimulus was presented on the same and the opposite body side with respect to the probe.},

@article{Timora2018,
	abstract = {According to the
              temporal principle
              of multisensory integration, cross-modal synchronisation of stimulus onset facilitates multisensory integration. This is typically observed as a greater response to multisensory stimulation relative to the sum of the constituent unisensory responses (i.e.,
              superadditivity
              ). The aim of the present study was to examine whether the temporal principle extends to the cross-modal synchrony of amplitude-modulation (AM) rate. It is well established that psychophysical sensitivity to AM stimulation is strongly influenced by AM rate where the optimum rate differs according to sensory modality. This rate-dependent sensitivity is also apparent from EEG steady-state response (SSR) activity, which becomes entrained to the stimulation rate and is thought to reflect neural processing of the temporal characteristics of AM stimulation. In this study we investigated whether cross-modal congruence of AM rate reveals both psychophysical and EEG evidence of enhanced multisensory integration. To achieve this, EEG SSR and psychophysical sensitivity to simultaneous acoustic and/or vibrotactile AM stimuli were measured at cross-modally congruent and incongruent AM rates. While the results provided no evidence of superadditive multisensory SSR activity or psychophysical sensitivity, the complex pattern of results did reveal a consistent correspondence between SSR activity and psychophysical sensitivity to AM stimulation. This indicates that entrained EEG activity may provide a direct measure of cortical activity underlying multisensory integration. Consistent with the temporal principle of multisensory integration, increased vibrotactile SSR responses and psychophysical sensitivity were found for cross-modally congruent relative to incongruent AM rate. However, no corresponding increase in auditory SSR or psychophysical sensitivity was observed for cross-modally congruent AM rates. This complex pattern of results can be understood in terms of the likely influence of the
              principle of inverse effectiveness
              where the temporal principle of multisensory integration was only evident in the context of reduced perceptual sensitivity for the vibrotactile but not the auditory modality.},

@article{Tyler2000,
	abstract = {Neural implementation of classical High-Threshold Theory reveals fundamental flaws in its applicability to realistic neural systems and to the two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) paradigm. For 2AFC, Signal Detection Theory provides a basis for accurate analysis of the observer's attentional strategy and effective degree of probability summation over attended neural channels. The resulting theory provides substantially different predictions from those of previous approximation analyses. In additive noise, attentional probability summation depends on the attentional model assumed. (1) For an ideal attentional strategy in additive noise, summation proceeds at a diminishing rate from an initial level of fourth-root summation for the first few channels. The maximum improvement asymptotes to about a factor of 4 by a million channels. (2) For a fixed attention field in additive noise, detection is highly inefficient at first and approximates fourth-root summation through the summation range. (3) In physiologically plausible root-multiplicative noise, on the other hand, attentional probability summation mimics a linear improvement in sensitivity up to about ten channels, approaching a factor of 1000 by a million channels. (4) Some noise sources, such as noise from eye movements, are fully multiplicative and would prevent threshold determination within their range of effectiveness. Such results may require reappraisal of previous interpretations of detection behavior in the 2AFC paradigm. {\copyright} 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Dykes1984,
	abstract = {Extracellular recordings of 209 neurons were obtained with carbon fiber-containing multibarrel micropipettes. The cells were isolated in the primary somatosensory cortex of cats anesthetized with barbiturate and classified according to the nature of their response to natural stimuli, the nature of the surrounding multiunit responses to the same stimuli, the response to thalamic stimulation, and their depth in the cortex. To study factors controlling the excitability of somatosensory neurons, their receptive fields were examined in the presence of iontophoretically administered gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate, and bicuculline methiodide (BMI). Even when the neurons were depolarized to perithreshold levels with glutamate, or when local inhibitory influences mediated by GABA were antagonized by BMI, the apparent specificity for one class of afferent input was maintained. Neurons responding to stimulation of either cutaneous or deep receptors maintained their modality specificity, and neurons in cutaneous rapidly adapting regions never took on slowly adapting properties. When ejected at currents that did not elicit action potentials, glutamate lowered the threshold for activation by cutaneous stimuli but did not enlarge the receptive field. With larger ejecting currents, the neurons developed an on-going discharge, but even at these higher doses, glutamate did not produce an increase in the receptive-field size. Some neurons in regions of cortex exhibiting slowly adapting multiunit responses were relatively insensitive to glutamate. These cells required four to five times more glutamate to evoke discharges than did most neurons. Other cells, previously unresponsive to somatic stimuli, could be shown to possess distinct cutaneous receptive fields when either glutamate or BMI was ejected in their vicinity. Iontophoretically administered BMI altered the firing pattern of somatosensory neurons, causing them to discharge in bursts of 3-15 impulses. BMI enlarged the receptive-field size of neurons in regions displaying rapidly adapting multiunit background discharges but not in those regions with slowly adapting multiunit discharges. This differential effect of BMI, suggesting that GABA controls receptive-field size in rapidly adapting regions, also indicates that neurons in rapidly adapting regions differ pharmacologically from those in other submodality regions. In all cortical regions, BMI blocked the poststimulus inhibitory period that normally followed thalamic stimulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

@article{Brumberg1996,
	abstract = {1. Extracellular single-unit recordings and controlled whisker stimuli were used to compare response properties of cells in the barreloids of the ventral posterior medial nucleus of the thalamus and the barrels in the rat primary somatosensory cortex. Whiskers were deflected alone or in combinations involving up to four immediately adjacent whiskers to assess their relative inhibitory and excitatory contributions to individual receptive fields. Quantitative data were obtained from 51 thalamocortical units (TCUs), 79 "regular-spiking" barrel neurons (RSUs), and 5 "fast-spiking" barrel neurons (FSUs) in 28 normal female adult rats. 2. A random-noise generator was used to produce small, continuously varying whisker movements that were applied to one to four adjacent whiskers while the principal (columnar) whisker was displaced with the use of a ramp-and-hold deflection. RSUs displayed adjacent whisker-evoked inhibition that increased as the number of adjacent whiskers stimulated was incremented. Asymptotic levels of inhibition were reached with the application of the noise stimulus to two or three adjacent whiskers depending on which particular combinations were deflected. By contrast, TCUs and FSUs showed weak, or no, surround inhibition. 3. As the number of adjacent whiskers stimulated increased, the background (prestimulus) activity in TCUs and FSUs increased, whereas displayed background activity in RSUs was relatively unaffected. The increase in background activity observed in the FSUs is hypothesized to mediate adjacent whisker-evoked inhibition in the RSUs. 4. A spatial gradient of adjacent whisker inhibition was observed in RSUs. The caudally adjacent whisker evoked more inhibition than the rostrally adjacent whisker, and the ventral more than the dorsal. A cortical origin for the gradient is suggested by the finding that TCUs did not show a spatial inhibitory gradient. 5. As the noise stimulus was applied to an increasing number of adjacent whiskers, RSUs became more sharply tuned for deflection angles. Neither TCUs nor FSUs showed increases in angular tuning. 6. Inhibition worked disproportionately in RSUs to inhibit those responses that were initially the least robust. For example, inhibition was most effective at reducing responses to nonpreferred versus preferred whisker deflection angles. 7. To assess the principal whisker's effect on adjacent whisker excitatory responses, the noise stimulus was applied to the principal whisker. In RSUs, principal whisker-evoked inhibition was more potent than adjacent whisker-evoked inhibition. FSUs were excited to a greater extent by the application of the noise stimulus to the principal whisker than to adjacent whiskers. TCUs did not display principal whisker-evoked inhibition. 8. Inhibition within the barrel serves as a contrast enhancement mechanism to differentiate small versus large magnitude responses. Less vigorous responses, such as those associated with perturbations of noncolumnar whiskers and inputs from nonoptimal deflection angles, are more strongly suppressed. During active touch, when many whiskers simultaneously palpate an object, these inhibitory interactions could effectively increase the "principal whiskerness" of the cortical column.},

@article{Baker2007,
	abstract = {How do signals from the 2 eyes combine and interact? Our recent work has challenged earlier schemes in which monocular contrast signals are subject to square-law transduction followed by summation across eyes and binocular gain control. Much more successful was a new 'two-stage' model in which the initial transducer was almost linear and contrast gain control occurred both pre- and post-binocular summation. Here we extend that work by: (i) exploring the two-dimensional stimulus space (defined by left- and right-eye contrasts) more thoroughly, and (ii) performing contrast discrimination and contrast matching tasks for the same stimuli. Twenty-five base-stimuli made from 1 c/deg patches of horizontal grating, were defined by the factorial combination of 5 contrasts for the left eye (0.3-32%) with five contrasts for the right eye (0.3-32%). Other than in contrast, the gratings in the two eyes were identical. In a 2IFC discrimination task, the base-stimuli were masks (pedestals), where the contrast increment was presented to one eye only. In a matching task, the base-stimuli were standards to which observers matched the contrast of either a monocular or binocular test grating. In the model, discrimination depends on the local gradient of the observer's internal contrast-response function, while matching equates the magnitude (rather than gradient) of response to the test and standard. With all model parameters fixed by previous work, the two-stage model successfully predicted both the discrimination and the matching data and was much more successful than linear or quadratic binocular summation models. These results show that performance measures and perception (contrast discrimination and contrast matching) can be understood in the same theoretical framework for binocular contrast vision.},

	abstract = {The visual system dissects the retinal image into millions of local analyses along numerous visual dimensions. However, our perceptions of the world are not fragmentary, so further processes must be involved in stitching it all back together. Simply summing up the responses would not work because this would convey an increase in image contrast with an increase in the number of mechanisms stimulated. Here, we consider a generic model of signal combination and counter-suppression designed to address this problem. The model is derived and tested for simple stimulus pairings (e.g. A + B), but is readily extended over multiple analysers. The model can account for nonlinear contrast transduction, dilution masking, and signal combination at threshold and above. It also predicts nonmonotonic psychometric functions where sensitivity to signal A in the presence of pedestal B first declines with increasing signal strength (paradoxically dropping below 50% correct in two-interval forced choice), but then rises back up again, producing a contour that follows the wings and neck of a swan. We looked for and found these "swan" functions in four different stimulus dimensions (ocularity, space, orientation, and time), providing some support for our proposal.},

	abstract = {Much progress has been made in understanding how the brain combines signals from the two eyes. However, most of this work has involved achromatic (black and white) stimuli, and it is not clear if the same processes apply in color-sensitive pathways. In our first experiment, we measured contrast discrimination ("dipper") functions for four key ocular configurations (monocular, binocular, half-binocular, and dichoptic), for achromatic, isoluminant L-M and isoluminant S-(L+M) sine-wave grating stimuli (L: long-, M: medium-, S: short-wavelength). We find a similar pattern of results across stimuli, implying equivalently strong interocular suppression within each pathway. Our second experiment measured dichoptic masking within and between pathways using the method of constant stimuli. Masking was strongest within-pathway and weakest between S-(L+M) and achromatic mechanisms. Finally, we repeated the dipper experiment using temporal luminance modulations, which produced slightly weaker interocular suppression than for spatially modulated stimuli. We interpret our results in the context of a contemporary two-stage model of binocular contrast gain control, implemented here using a hierarchical Bayesian framework. Posterior distributions of the weight of interocular suppression overlapped with a value of 1 for all dipper data sets, and the model captured well the pattern of thresholds from all three experiments.},

A meta-analysis of 65 studies published across more than 5 decades shows definitively that psychophysical binocular summation (the ratio of binocular to monocular contrast sensitivity) is significantly greater than the canonical value of √2. Several methodological factors were also found to affect summation estimates. Binocular summation was significantly affected by both the spatial and temporal frequency of the stimulus, and stimulus speed (the ratio of temporal to spatial frequency) systematically predicts summation levels, with slow speeds (high spatial and low temporal frequencies) producing the strongest summation. We furthermore show that empirical summation estimates are affected by the ratio of monocular sensitivities, which varies across individuals, and is abnormal in visual disorders such as amblyopia. A simple modeling framework is presented to interpret the results of summation experiments. In combination with the empirical results, this model suggests that there is no single value for binocular summation, but instead that summation ratios depend on methodological factors that influence the strength of a nonlinearity occurring early in the visual pathway, before binocular combination of signals. Best practice methodological guidelines are proposed for obtaining accurate estimates of neural summation in future studies, including those involving patient groups with impaired binocular vision.

	abstract = {This paper extends previous work (Gandevia & McCloskey, 1976) on proprioception in the terminal joint of the middle finger. By positioning the finger in appropriate ways proprioceptive acuity at the joint can be assessed when no muscular afferents could contribute, or when afferents in the flexor but not the extensor could contribute, or when afferents from both muscles could contribute. Digital nerve block anaesthetizes joint and cutaneous receptors and so was used to study the contributions from muscle afferents in isolation. Displacements (10 degrees) at various angular velocities were better detected when muscle afferents from both flexor and extensor muscles could contribute. This was so whether joint and cutaneous receptors were also available, or after digital anaesthesia. Performance when only muscle afferents are available is, however, inferior to that when all sensory mechanisms are intact. It is concluded that muscle afferents contribute to kinaesthesia, and that a full complement of such receptors from agonist and antagonist muscles gives superior acuity to that achieved when only the receptors of one of the muscle groups is available. The angular displacements necessary for 70% correct detection were determined at angular velocities between 0.25 degrees and 160 degrees/s. Proprioceptive performance was optimal with all proprioceptive mechanisms intact over the range of angular velocities 10 degrees -80 degrees/s: 70% correct detection of displacements of 0.8 degrees-1.2 degrees occurred in this range. Performance deteriorated slightly at higher velocities of displacement. Performance was significantly poorer when only joint and cutaneous receptors could contribute (in the absence of intramuscular receptors), and when only intramuscular receptors could contribute (in the absence of joint and cutaneous receptors). Full proprioceptive acuity depends upon the availability of receptors in muscles and in skin and/or joints.},

@article{Baker2020,
	abstract = {The brain combines sounds from the two ears, but what is the algorithm used to achieve this summation of signals? Here we combine psychophysical amplitude modulation discrimination and steady-state electroencephalography (EEG) data to investigate the architecture of binaural combination for amplitude-modulated tones. Discrimination thresholds followed a 'dipper' shaped function of pedestal modulation depth, and were consistently lower for binaural than monaural presentation of modulated tones. The EEG responses were greater for binaural than monaural presentation of modulated tones, and when a masker was presented to one ear, it produced only weak suppression of the response to a signal presented to the other ear. Both data sets were well-fit by a computational model originally derived for visual signal combination, but with suppression between the two channels (ears) being much weaker than in binocular vision. We suggest that the distinct ecological constraints on vision and hearing can explain this difference, if it is assumed that the brain avoids over-representing sensory signals originating from a single object. These findings position our understanding of binaural summation in a broader context of work on sensory signal combination in the brain, and delineate the similarities and differences between vision and hearing.},

Thresholds were found to increase as a function of age, but the rate of increase was greater after than before the age of 65 years. The rate of loss of vibrotactile sensitivity was substantially greater in the P channel (mediated by Pacinian corpuscles) than in the NP I channel (mediated by rapidly adapting fibers), the NP II channel (mediated by slowly adapting type II fibers), or the NP III channel (mediated by slowly adapting type I fibers). Women were frequently found to have greater sensitivity than men.},

@article{Bolanowski1988,
	abstract = {Although previous physiological and anatomical experiments have identified four afferent fiber types (PC, RA, SA II, and SA I) in glabrous (nonhairy) skin of the human somatosensory periphery, only three have been shown to mediate tactile (mechanoreceptive) sensation. Psychophysical evidence that four channels (P, NP I, NP II, and NP III) do, indeed, participate in the perceptual process is presented. In a series of experiments involving selective masking of the various channels, modification of the skin-surface temperature, and testing cutaneous sensitivity down to very low-vibratory frequencies, the fourth psychophysical channel (NP III) is defined. Based on these experiments and previous work from our laboratory, it is concluded that the four channels work in conjunction at threshold to create an operating range for the perception of vibration that extends from at least 0.4 to greater than 500 Hz. Each of the four channels appears to mediate specific portions of the overall threshold-frequency characteristic. Selection of appropriate neural-response criteria from previously published physiological data and correlation of their derived frequency characteristics with the four psychophysical channels indicates that each channel has its own physiological substrate: P channel and PC fibers, NP I channel and RA fibers, NP II channel and SA II fibers, and NP III channel and SA I fibers. These channels partially overlap in their absolute sensitivities, making it likely that suprathreshold stimuli may activate two or more of the channels at the same time. Thus the perceptual qualities of touch may be determined by the combined inputs from four channels.},

	abstract = {Thresholds were measured for the detection of vibratory stimuli of variable frequency and duration applied to the index fingertip and thenar eminence through contactors of different sizes. The effects of stimulus frequency could be accounted for by the frequency characteristics of the Pacinian (P), non-Pacinian (NP) I, and NP III channels previously determined for the thenar eminence (Bolanowski et al., J Acoust Soc Am 84: 1680-1694, 1988; Gescheider et al., Somatosens Mot Res 18: 191-201, 2001). The effect of changing stimulus duration was also essentially identical for both sites, demonstrating the same amount of temporal summation in the P channel. Although the effect of changing stimulus frequency and changing stimulus duration did not differ for the two sites, the effect of varying the size of the stimulus was significantly greater for the thenar eminence than for the fingertip. The attenuated amount of spatial summation on the fingertip was interpreted as an indication that the mechanism of spatial summation consists of the operations of both neural integration and probability summation.},

@article{Porcu2014,
	abstract = {We investigated whether unattended visual, auditory and tactile stimuli compete for capacity-limited early sensory processing across senses. In three experiments, we probed competitive audio-visual, visuo-tactile and audio-tactile stimulus interactions. To this end, continuous visual, auditory and tactile stimulus streams ('reference' stimuli) were frequency-tagged to elicit steady-state responses (SSRs). These electrophysiological oscillatory brain responses indexed ongoing stimulus processing in corresponding senses. To induce competition, we introduced transient frequency-tagged stimuli in same and/or different senses ('competitors') during reference presentation. Participants performed a separate visual discrimination task at central fixation to control for attentional biases of sensory processing. A comparison of reference-driven SSR amplitudes between competitor-present and competitor-absent periods revealed reduced amplitudes when a competitor was presented in the same sensory modality as the reference. Reduced amplitudes indicated the competitor's suppressive influence on reference stimulus processing. Crucially, no such suppression was found when a competitor was presented in a different than the reference modality. These results strongly suggest that early sensory competition is exclusively modality-specific and does not extend across senses. We discuss consequences of these findings for modeling the neural mechanisms underlying intermodal attention.},

@article{Timora2018,
	abstract = {According to the temporal principle of multisensory integration, cross-modal synchronisation of stimulus onset facilitates multisensory integration. This is typically observed as a greater response to multisensory stimulation relative to the sum of the constituent unisensory responses (i.e., superadditivity). The aim of the present study was to examine whether the temporal principle extends to the cross-modal synchrony of amplitude-modulation (AM) rate. It is well established that psychophysical sensitivity to AM stimulation is strongly influenced by AM rate where the optimum rate differs according to sensory modality. This rate-dependent sensitivity is also apparent from EEG steady-state response (SSR) activity, which becomes entrained to the stimulation rate and is thought to reflect neural processing of the temporal characteristics of AM stimulation. In this study we investigated whether cross-modal congruence of AM rate reveals both psychophysical and EEG evidence of enhanced multisensory integration. To achieve this, EEG SSR and psychophysical sensitivity to simultaneous acoustic and/or vibrotactile AM stimuli were measured at cross-modally congruent and incongruent AM rates. While the results provided no evidence of superadditive multisensory SSR activity or psychophysical sensitivity, the complex pattern of results did reveal a consistent correspondence between SSR activity and psychophysical sensitivity to AM stimulation. This indicates that entrained EEG activity may provide a direct measure of cortical activity underlying multisensory integration. Consistent with the temporal principle of multisensory integration, increased vibrotactile SSR responses and psychophysical sensitivity were found for cross-modally congruent relative to incongruent AM rate. However, no corresponding increase in auditory SSR or psychophysical sensitivity was observed for cross-modally congruent AM rates. This complex pattern of results can be understood in terms of the likely influence of the principle of inverse effectiveness where the temporal principle of multisensory integration was only evident in the context of reduced perceptual sensitivity for the vibrotactile but not the auditory modality.},

@article{Baker2013,
	abstract = {The visual system dissects the retinal image into millions of local analyses along numerous visual dimensions. However, our perceptions of the world are not fragmentary, so further processes must be involved in stitching it all back together. Simply summing up the responses would not work because this would convey an increase in image contrast with an increase in the number of mechanisms stimulated. Here, we consider a generic model of signal combination and counter-suppression designed to address this problem. The model is derived and tested for simple stimulus pairings (e.g. A + B), but is readily extended over multiple analysers. The model can account for nonlinear contrast transduction, dilution masking, and signal combination at threshold and above. It also predicts nonmonotonic psychometric functions where sensitivity to signal A in the presence of pedestal B first declines with increasing signal strength (paradoxically dropping below 50% correct in two-interval forced choice), but then rises back up again, producing a contour that follows the wings and neck of a swan. We looked for and found these "swan" functions in four different stimulus dimensions (ocularity, space, orientation, and time), providing some support for our proposal.},

@article{Baker2024,
	abstract = {Much progress has been made in understanding how the brain combines signals from the two eyes. However, most of this work has involved achromatic (black and white) stimuli, and it is not clear if the same processes apply in color-sensitive pathways. In our first experiment, we measured contrast discrimination ("dipper") functions for four key ocular configurations (monocular, binocular, half-binocular, and dichoptic), for achromatic, isoluminant L-M and isoluminant S-(L+M) sine-wave grating stimuli (L: long-, M: medium-, S: short-wavelength). We find a similar pattern of results across stimuli, implying equivalently strong interocular suppression within each pathway. Our second experiment measured dichoptic masking within and between pathways using the method of constant stimuli. Masking was strongest within-pathway and weakest between S-(L+M) and achromatic mechanisms. Finally, we repeated the dipper experiment using temporal luminance modulations, which produced slightly weaker interocular suppression than for spatially modulated stimuli. We interpret our results in the context of a contemporary two-stage model of binocular contrast gain control, implemented here using a hierarchical Bayesian framework. Posterior distributions of the weight of interocular suppression overlapped with a value of 1 for all dipper data sets, and the model captured well the pattern of thresholds from all three experiments.},

@article{Tyler2000,
	abstract = {Neural implementation of classical High-Threshold Theory reveals fundamental flaws in its applicability to realistic neural systems and to the two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) paradigm. For 2AFC, Signal Detection Theory provides a basis for accurate analysis of the observer's attentional strategy and effective degree of probability summation over attended neural channels. The resulting theory provides substantially different predictions from those of previous approximation analyses. In additive noise, attentional probability summation depends on the attentional model assumed. (1) For an ideal attentional strategy in additive noise, summation proceeds at a diminishing rate from an initial level of fourth-root summation for the first few channels. The maximum improvement asymptotes to about a factor of 4 by a million channels. (2) For a fixed attention field in additive noise, detection is highly inefficient at first and approximates fourth-root summation through the summation range. (3) In physiologically plausible root-multiplicative noise, on the other hand, attentional probability summation mimics a linear improvement in sensitivity up to about ten channels, approaching a factor of 1000 by a million channels. (4) Some noise sources, such as noise from eye movements, are fully multiplicative and would prevent threshold determination within their range of effectiveness. Such results may require reappraisal of previous interpretations of detection behavior in the 2AFC paradigm.},

Using these signals to characterize and locate neural activation in the brain is a challenge that requires expertise in physics, signal processing, statistics, and numerical methods. As part of the MNE software suite, MNE-Python is an open-source software package that addresses this challenge by providing state-of-the-art algorithms implemented in Python that cover multiple methods of data preprocessing, source localization, statistical analysis, and estimation of functional connectivity between distributed brain regions. All algorithms and utility functions are implemented in a consistent manner with well-documented interfaces, enabling users to create M/EEG data analysis pipelines by writing Python scripts. Moreover, MNE-Python is tightly integrated with the core Python libraries for scientific comptutation (NumPy, SciPy) and visualization (matplotlib and Mayavi), as well as the greater neuroimaging ecosystem in Python via the Nibabel package. The code is provided under the new BSD license allowing code reuse, even in commercial products. Although MNE-Python has only been under heavy development for a couple of years, it has rapidly evolved with expanded analysis capabilities and pedagogical tutorials because multiple labs have collaborated during code development to help share best practices. MNE-Python also gives easy access to preprocessed datasets, helping users to get started quickly and facilitating reproducibility of methods by other researchers.

@article{Schutt2016,
	abstract = {The psychometric function describes how an experimental variable, such as stimulus strength, influences the behaviour of an observer. Estimation of psychometric functions from experimental data plays a central role in fields such as psychophysics, experimental psychology and in the behavioural neurosciences. Experimental data may exhibit substantial overdispersion, which may result from non-stationarity in the behaviour of observers. Here we extend the standard binomial model which is typically used for psychometric function estimation to a beta-binomial model. We show that the use of the beta-binomial model makes it possible to determine accurate credible intervals even in data which exhibit substantial overdispersion. This goes beyond classical measures for overdispersion-goodness-of-fit-which can detect overdispersion but provide no method to do correct inference for overdispersed data. We use Bayesian inference methods for estimating the posterior distribution of the parameters of the psychometric function. Unlike previous Bayesian psychometric inference methods our software implementation-psignifit 4-performs numerical integration of the posterior within automatically determined bounds. This avoids the use of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods typically requiring expert knowledge. Extensive numerical tests show the validity of the approach and we discuss implications of overdispersion for experimental design. A comprehensive MATLAB toolbox implementing the method is freely available; a python implementation providing the basic capabilities is also available.},

	abstract = {Psychophysical thresholds for the detection of a 300-Hz burst of vibration applied to the thenar eminence were measured for stimuli applied to the skin through 1.5 cm2 and through 0.05 cm2 contactors. Thresholds were approximately 13 dB lower when the area of the contactor was 1.5 cm2 than when it was 0.05 cm2. The difference between the thresholds measured with the large and small contactors was significantly reduced when only the lowest thresholds obtained in the testing sessions were considered. This result supports the hypothesis that one component of spatial summation in the P channel is probability summation. In addition, threshold measurements within a session were less variable when measured with the 1.5 cm2 contactor. We conclude that spatial summation in the P channel is a joint function of two processes that occur as the areal extent of the stimulus increases: probability summation in which the probability of exceeding the psychophysical detection threshold increases as the number of receptors of varying sensitivities increases, and neural integration in which neural activity originating from separate receptors is combined within the central nervous system rendering the channel more sensitive to the stimulus.},

	abstract = {Thresholds for the perception of vibration on the hand reduce with increasing area of excitation when the thresholds are mediated by the Pacinian channel (a phenomenon known as spatial summation) but thresholds are generally independent of the area of excitation when they are mediated by non-Pacinian channels. The effect of the area of excitation on vibrotactile thresholds at the sole of the foot has not been thoroughly investigated. In the study reported in this paper, thresholds for the perception of 20 Hz vibration and 160 Hz vibration were determined on the foot (at the big toe (hallux), the medial (inside) ball, the lateral (outside) ball, and the heel) and on the hand (at the thenar eminence and at the fingertip) in 12 male subjects using four probe diameters: 1mm (0.19 cm(2) excitation area), 3mm (0.38 cm(2)), 6 mm (0.78 mm(2)) and 10 mm (1.53 cm(2)) with a 2mm gap between the vibrating probe and a fixed surround. On both the hand and the foot, thresholds for the perception of 160 Hz vibration decreased as the probe diameter increased. There was no overall consistent change in thresholds for the perception of 20 Hz vibration. Thresholds for the perception of 160 Hz vibration were lowest at the fingertip and highest at the big toe. Thresholds for 20 Hz vibration were also lowest at the fingertip. It is concluded that on the sole of the foot there is evidence of spatial summation in the perception of 160 Hz vibration, mediated by the Pacinian channel, but not in the perception of 20 Hz vibration, mediated by a non-Pacinian channel. The findings show that vibrotactile thresholds at the foot obtained with different areas of excitation, or an unknown area of excitation, should not be compared. It is concluded that there is a need to standardise methods of measuring the vibrotactile thresholds at the foot that are obtained for clinical applications.},

	abstract = {Interaction of simultaneous tactile input at two finger sites in primary (SI) and secondary somatosensory cortex (SII) was studied by whole-head magnetoencephalography. Short pressure pulses were delivered to fingers of the right and left hand at an interstimulus interval of 1.6 s. The first phalanx of the left digit 1 and four other sites were stimulated either separately or simultaneously. We compared four sites with increasing distance: the second phalanx of left digit 1, left digit 5, and digits 1 and 5 of the right hand. The temporal evolution of source activity in the contralateral SI and bilateral SII was calculated using spatiotemporal source analysis. Interaction was assessed by comparing the source activity during simultaneous stimulation with the sum of the source activities elicited by separate stimulation. Significant suppressive interaction was observed in contralateral SI only for stimuli at the same hand, decreasing with distance. In SII, all digits of the same and the opposite hand interacted significantly with left digit 1. When stimulating bilaterally, SII source waveforms closely resembled the time course of the response to separate stimulation of the opposite hand. Thus, in bilateral simultaneous stimulation, the contralateral input arriving first in SII appeared to inhibit the later ipsilateral input. Similarly, the separate response to input at two unilateral finger sites which arrived slightly earlier in SII dominated the simultaneous response. Our results confirm previous findings of considerable overlap in the cortical hand representation in SII and illustrate hemispheric specialization to contralateral input when simultaneous stimuli occur bilaterally.},

	abstract = {A fundamental problem for any visual system with binocular overlap is the combination of information from the two eyes. Electrophysiology shows that binocular integration of luminance contrast occurs early in visual cortex, but a specific systems architecture has not been established for human vision. Here, we address this by performing binocular summation and monocular, binocular, and dichoptic masking experiments for horizontal 1 cycle per degree test and masking gratings. These data reject three previously published proposals, each of which predict too little binocular summation and insufficient dichoptic facilitation. However, a simple development of one of the rejected models (the twin summation model) and a completely new model (the two-stage model) provide very good fits to the data. Two features common to both models are gently accelerating (almost linear) contrast transduction prior to binocular summation and suppressive ocular interactions that contribute to contrast gain control. With all model parameters fixed, both models correctly predict (1) systematic variation in psychometric slopes, (2) dichoptic contrast matching, and (3) high levels of binocular summation for various levels of binocular pedestal contrast. A review of evidence from elsewhere leads us to favor the two-stage model.},

	abstract = {Contrast masking was studied psychophysically. A two-alternative forced-choice procedure was used to measure contrast thresholds for 2.0 cpd sine-wave gratings in the presence of masking sine-wave gratings. Thresholds were measured for 11 masker contrasts spanning three log units, and seven masker frequencies ranging +/- one octave from the signal frequency. Corresponding measurements were made for gratings with horizontal widths of 0.75 degrees (narrow fields) and 6.0 degrees (wide fields). For high contrast maskers at all frequencies, signal thresholds were related to masking contrast by power functions with exponents near 0.6. For a range of low masking contrasts, signal thresholds were reduced by the masker. For the wide fields, high contrast masking tuning functions peaked at the signal frequency, were slightly asymmetric, and had approximately invariant half-maximum frequencies that lie 3/4 octave below and 1 octave above the signal frequency. The corresponding low contrast tuning functions exhibited peak threshold reduction at the signal frequency, with half-minimum frequencies at roughly +/- 0.25 octaves. For the narrow fields, the masking tuning functions were much broader at both low and high masking contrasts. A masking model is presented that encompasses contrast detection, discrimination, and masking phenomena. Central constructs of the model include a linear spatial frequency filter, a nonlinear transducer, and a process of spatial pooling that acts at low contrasts only.},

	abstract = {1. It is known that an object is less detectable when it is viewed against a background containing structures similar to the object. The effect of changing the orientation between the object and background is investigated.2. Gratings of variable contrast were generated on two oscilloscopes; these were superimposed optically. The angle of orientation between them could be changed. The threshold of one grating, the test grating, was determined in the presence of the other, the masking grating.3. When the gratings were presented with the same orientation (and locked in phase) the increment threshold of the test grating was found to be proportional to the suprathreshold contrast of the masking grating.4. As the angle between the test and masking gratings was increased the masking effect fell exponentially.5. At 12 degrees on either side of a vertical test grating the masking effect was reduced by a factor of two with respect to its maximum value. This angle was independent of the contrast level of masking, the focus, and also the phase coherence of the masking grating.6. If the test grating was presented obliquely the effect of masking was slightly less.7. The narrow orientationally tuned channels found psychophysically by this masking technique are compared with the orientationally sensitive cells discovered electrophysiologically in the visual cortex of the cat.},

@article{Baker2018,
	abstract = {Our ability to detect faint images is better with two eyes than with one, but how great is this improvement? A meta-analysis of 65 studies published across more than 5 decades shows definitively that psychophysical binocular summation (the ratio of binocular to monocular contrast sensitivity) is significantly greater than the canonical value of √2. Several methodological factors were also found to affect summation estimates. Binocular summation was significantly affected by both the spatial and temporal frequency of the stimulus, and stimulus speed (the ratio of temporal to spatial frequency) systematically predicts summation levels, with slow speeds (high spatial and low temporal frequencies) producing the strongest summation. We furthermore show that empirical summation estimates are affected by the ratio of monocular sensitivities, which varies across individuals, and is abnormal in visual disorders such as amblyopia. A simple modeling framework is presented to interpret the results of summation experiments. In combination with the empirical results, this model suggests that there is no single value for binocular summation, but instead that summation ratios depend on methodological factors that influence the strength of a nonlinearity occurring early in the visual pathway, before binocular combination of signals. Best practice methodological guidelines are proposed for obtaining accurate estimates of neural summation in future studies, including those involving patient groups with impaired binocular vision.

Recent studies have also suggested that close interactions of neural responses could occur even across sensory modalities, especially for audio-visual interactions. However, direct behavioral evidence regarding the audio-visual perceptual suppression effect has not been reported in a study with humans. Here, we investigated whether sound could have a suppressive effect on visual perception. We found that white noise bursts presented through headphones degraded visual orientation discrimination performance. This auditory suppression effect on visual perception frequently occurred when these inputs were presented in a spatially and temporally consistent manner. These results indicate that the perceptual suppression effect could occur across auditory and visual modalities based on close and direct neural interactions among those sensory inputs.},

Here, we demonstrate that tactile stimulation can suppress the percept of visual stimuli: Visual orientation discrimination performance was degraded when a tactile vibration was applied to the observer's index finger of hands. We also demonstrated that this tactile suppression effect on visual perception occurred primarily when the tactile and visual information were spatially and temporally consistent.

	abstract = {This paper extends previous work (Gandevia & McCloskey, 1976) on proprioception in the terminal joint of the middle finger. By positioning the finger in appropriate ways proprioceptive acuity at the joint can be assessed when no muscular afferents could contribute, or when afferents in the flexor but not the extensor could contribute, or when afferents from both muscles could contribute. Digital nerve block anaesthetizes joint and cutaneous receptors and so was used to study the contributions from muscle afferents in isolation. Displacements (10 degrees) at various angular velocities were better detected when muscle afferents from both flexor and extensor muscles could contribute. This was so whether joint and cutaneous receptors were also available, or after digital anaesthesia. Performance when only muscle afferents are available is, however, inferior to that when all sensory mechanisms are intact. It is concluded that muscle afferents contribute to kinaesthesia, and that a full complement of such receptors from agonist and antagonist muscles gives superior acuity to that achieved when only the receptors of one of the muscle groups is available. The angular displacements necessary for 70% correct detection were determined at angular velocities between 0.25 degrees and 160 degrees/s. Proprioceptive performance was optimal with all proprioceptive mechanisms intact over the range of angular velocities 10 degrees -80 degrees/s: 70% correct detection of displacements of 0.8 degrees-1.2 degrees occurred in this range. Performance deteriorated slightly at higher velocities of displacement. Performance was significantly poorer when only joint and cutaneous receptors could contribute (in the absence of intramuscular receptors), and when only intramuscular receptors could contribute (in the absence of joint and cutaneous receptors). Full proprioceptive acuity depends upon the availability of receptors in muscles and in skin and/or joints.},

Evoked responses to single digit stimulation were explained by time-varying equivalent current dipoles (ECDs) located in SI. These ECDs were then used to explain responses to stimulation of digit pairs. A cortical interaction ratio (IR) was defined as the vector sum of peak source amplitudes to separate stimulations of two fingers divided by the vector sum of source amplitudes to simultaneous stimulation of the two digits. Mean IR was significantly higher (P<0.05; Wilcoxon test) for digit pair II + I (1.69+/- 0.15) compared to digit pair II + V (1.14+/- 0.12).

@article{Baker2020,
	abstract = {The brain combines sounds from the two ears, but what is the algorithm used to achieve this summation of signals? Here we combine psychophysical amplitude modulation discrimination and steady-state electroencephalography (EEG) data to investigate the architecture of binaural combination for amplitude-modulated tones. Discrimination thresholds followed a 'dipper' shaped function of pedestal modulation depth, and were consistently lower for binaural than monaural presentation of modulated tones. The EEG responses were greater for binaural than monaural presentation of modulated tones, and when a masker was presented to one ear, it produced only weak suppression of the response to a signal presented to the other ear. Both data sets were well-fit by a computational model originally derived for visual signal combination, but with suppression between the two channels (ears) being much weaker than in binocular vision. We suggest that the distinct ecological constraints on vision and hearing can explain this difference, if it is assumed that the brain avoids over-representing sensory signals originating from a single object. These findings position our understanding of binaural summation in a broader context of work on sensory signal combination in the brain, and delineate the similarities and differences between vision and hearing.},
